## Why ShooterStopper❓
Because June 3rd is National Gun Violence Day, our team wanted to spread awareness by creating ShooterStopper. As the innocent lives that are lost due to school shootings are irreplaceable, we want to prevent further school shootings to ensure the safety of students everywhere.
